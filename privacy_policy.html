    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Inburgering Mate ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy.
        This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Dutch language learning application.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>We do not collect any personal information.</strong> The app is designed to work entirely offline
        and does not require user accounts, registration, or any personal data.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
        All data related to your learning progress (such as completed lessons and vocabulary progress)
        is stored locally on your device only. This data:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Never leaves your device</li>
        <li>Is not transmitted to any servers</li>
        <li>Is not accessible to us or any third parties</li>
        <li>Can be deleted by uninstalling the app</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The app does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
        We do not share any information with third parties because we do not collect any information.
    </p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>
        If you make an in-app purchase to unlock premium features, the transaction is processed
        entirely by Apple (App Store) or Google (Play Store). We do not have access to your
        payment information. Please refer to Apple's or Google's privacy policies for information
        about how they handle payment data.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Our app does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13.
        The app is safe for users of all ages.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page
        with an updated revision date.
    </p>
